## Types

- string: Unicode characters representing some text, like "hi terraform" " "hi".
- number (like an `int`): a numeric value. The number type can represent both whole numbers like 15 or 54 and fractional values like 6.28.
- bool: Either true or false.
- list (`tuple`): a sequence of values, like ["us-west-1a", "us-west-1c"]. Elements in a list or tuple are identified by consecutive whole numbers, starting with zero.
- map (or object): a group of values identified by named labels, like {name = "Mabel", age = 52}.
